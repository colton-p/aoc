- easy way to copy input to xx.in file

- template for next day's script

- primality check
- prime factors
   - non-prime factors too


prefabs:
  [x] dfs
  [x] dijkstra
  [x] knapsack
  - emulator
  - tree traversal
  - tsp == score all permutations
  - generalized pairwise: 'abcde' -> [ 'ab' 'bc' 'cd' ...]
  - celluar automata
      - 1d
      - 2d
  - vector math

  - grid -> networkx graph
  - adj func -> networkx graph


  - grid -> all pairs distances -> tsp?

  - better input:
    -> list of numbers
    -> grid
    -> instructions???
    -> single string


 - somehow recognize structured input:
    - ["Alice sends 10 units to Bob.", "Bob sends 20 units to Alice"]
      --> ["Alice", 10, "Bob"], ["Bob", 20, "Alice"]

    - need to recognize distinct groups of things too:
        "Alice sends 10 units to Bob" vs. "Bob eats 10 units."

Grid class
    - to/from grid
    - to networkx graph
    - adjacent fns?
    - implicit grid???


2d automaton class
    - like implicit grid, with rules
    - evolve method
    - state count
    - repeat detection


Run input analyze on all inputs
Finish problem summary



Clean up below:

Template for each day's problem:
  - autogenerate meta script
    - all includes
    - basic scaffold

Easy input grabbing
  - fetch once, cache
  - read with test option


Prefabs
  - go through list and clean up
  - maybe entry points for nx library for graph theory
    - decide on the most useful traversal guy

Better input parsing:
  - list of numbers
  - grid
  - instructions?
  - single string

Input recognition:
  - ["Alice sends 10 units to Bob.", "Bob sends 20 units to Alice"]
    --> ["Alice", 10, "Bob"], ["Bob", 20, "Alice"]
  - need to recognize distinct groups of things too:
    --> "Alice sends 10 units to Bob" vs. "Bob eats 10 units."

Other
  - primality check
  - prime factors
     - non-prime factors too

  prefabs:
    [x] dfs
    [x] dijkstra
    [x] knapsack
    - emulator
    - tree traversal
    - tsp == score all permutations
    - generalized pairwise: 'abcde' -> [ 'ab' 'bc' 'cd' ...]
    - celluar automata
        - 1d
        - 2d
    - vector math

    - grid -> networkx graph
    - adj func -> networkx graph


    - grid -> all pairs distances -> tsp?
